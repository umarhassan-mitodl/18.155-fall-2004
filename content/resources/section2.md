This resource contains lecture discourse which describes how an outer measure such as nu is a rather crude object since, even
if the Ai are disjoint, there is generally strict inequality, how unreasonable it is to expect equality in it, and for disjoint
unions, for a function defined on all subsets of X and why should we restrict
attention to smaller collections of subsets and supporting definitions, theorems, prpopositions and proofs.
